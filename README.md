# Fraction
The goal of this project was to have a simple, easy to use fraction class that could be used like any other primitive data type.
The class uses operator overloads so you can do things like frac1 = frac2 * frac3.

Overloads added so far are +, - , *, /, ^ and a root function.

Most fractions are auto simplified. Ex: 2/6 = 1/3

Included is a test project so you can see how it works.
